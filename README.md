# Groupling Project Outline
### Overview
Groupling is a webapp that is used to coordinate group trips. I go to conventions and vacations with people from all over the world and we usually all stay in the same area and like to organize group activities. Organizing activities and keeping track of itineraries for a number of people can get a bit tedious. 

Using a shareable document is usually the route we take. Having a webapp dedicated to this specific need will make this more streamlined and accessible. Groupling will have the ability to set up a group stay with reservation info, travel itineraries, local social spots, group outings, links to Whatsapp and other useful links. 

### Features
* **Highly Responsive** Using React and Firebase, I'm creating a single page app to make it as fast and user friendly as
                        possible.
* **PIN Login** Users won't have to remember a username/password. A PIN will be shared with them to easily login.
* **Database driven** Using Firebase, the webapp will capture user information and aggregate it in a useful manner.
* **Google Maps** I will be incorporating Google API to include various personalized locations on the app.

### Technologies
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* ReactJS
* Firebase
* Bootstrap
* Google Maps API

### What I'll Have to Learn
To create this project, I will have to learn the ReactJS framework. In addition to ReactJS, I will have the opportunity to use Firebase. I've played around a bit with Bootstrap previously but, this will give me the chance to really get comfortable with it. I will be using micro-interactions and flat design to make the site clean, clever, and user-friendly.
